# Print_Divider

This repo has files that will be used to create a Github template.  The Github template will then be used with those R Packages having functions
that print sectional dividers.  There will be Packages with functions used when codeing R in the Jupyter IRkernel.  These functions will output
dividers into the Jupyter markup cells.  Other Package funcitons will be used when using vsCode and R Studio.  These files are basic template files
that required editing.  Files were pushed from the PC (C:\github\).   

The downstream purpose of these R Packages and this github repo template is to provide an envionment of "repeatability", which is necessary for creating
multiple R Packages -  with the goal of creating an R Package that becomes accepted by CRAN. 

These files are only general outlines of those actual files that are created and modified when creating an R Package.  These .R files 
have most of the code necessary for writing the actual functions. But these .R files do not include the Roxygen2 skeletons.  There is 
no NAMESPACE file included with these files - which will be created during the process of creating the R package.  

These files are not complete enough for an R Package to be pass the Build & Clean, or "check" Package review steps.
